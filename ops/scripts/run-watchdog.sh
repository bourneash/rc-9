# run-watchdog.sh — cron-container entrypoint for the self-healing watchdog.

# Mirrors run-deployer.sh's cost discipline: the CHEAP half (active probes,
# incident gather, cooldown/eligibility) runs right here in the lightweight cron
# container (bash + python3 + curl — no worker spin, 0 API cost). Only when an
# eligible OPEN incident exists do we spin a worker container (which has claude +
# node + npm) to run the full watchdog repair pass.
#
# watchdog.sh --detect-only exits:
#   0  → healthy, or everything is cooling down / escalated → done, no spin.
#   10 → an eligible incident needs a model repair → spin the worker.
#   *  → unexpected error → spin the worker anyway (fail safe; worst case a
#        no-op repair run).
