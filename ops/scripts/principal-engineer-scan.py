"""principal-engineer-scan.py — the ZERO-token half of the principal-engineer
cron-direct role. Reads ops/logs/slack-*.jsonl (the disk record every Slack
post now makes — see notify-slack.sh), finds new error/warning entries since
the last cursor, dedupes them against open incident records using the same
overlap-coefficient vocabulary matching as run-engineer.sh's escalation
de-dupe (deliberately not Jaccard — see that script's comment for why), and
decides AT MOST ONE incident to act on this tick (cost bound, same guardrail
watchdog uses).

Prints one JSON object to stdout:
  {"action": "none"}
  {"action": "act", "fp": "...", "summary": "...", "text": "...",
   "occurrence": N, "channel": "..."}

Never raises past main() — a scanning bug must fail safe to "no work found",
not crash the cron tick or (worse) spin a worker every 5 minutes forever.
